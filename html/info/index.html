                    1990s was a fascinating and controversial subculture that
                    revolved around the piracy and distribution of software,
                    particularly on the Amiga platform. The Amiga computer, known
                    for its advanced graphics and audio capabilities, gained a
                    dedicated following among computer enthusiasts, but its high
                    software prices and limited availability of legitimate titles
                    contributed to the rise of the Warez Culture.

                    individuals known as "warez d00dz" or "crackers" would break the
                    copy protection on commercial Amiga software and distribute it
                    through various channels, including bulletin board systems
                    (BBSs), floppy disk exchanges, and later, the emerging world of
                    the internet. These software pirates were often motivated by a
                    desire to make expensive software accessible to a wider audience
                    or to demonstrate their technical prowess.

                    competition among enthusiasts. Groups of crackers formed "warez
                    groups," each with its own unique branding, and they would
                    compete to release cracked versions of popular Amiga games and
                    applications as quickly as possible. These releases were often
                    accompanied by elaborate intro screens and digital "cracktros"
                    that showcased the skills and creativity of the groups involved.

                    phenomenon emerged in the world of pirated games with the advent
                    of crack intros. Before the actual game would start, these
                    intros displayed the names of the individuals responsible for
                    creating the pirated copies, along with any messages they wished
                    to convey. Initially, these intros consisted of plain text, but
                    over time, they evolved into more elaborate presentations,
                    incorporating GIFs, music, and vibrant designs.

                    proliferation of bulletin board systems (BBS) from the 1980s
                    into the 1990s transformed the landscape of pirated video game
                    sharing. Users could connect their personal computers to
                    telephone modems, dial into dedicated servers, and exchange
                    copies of video games within the burgeoning Warez scene.
                    Notably, this system gained popularity before the widespread
                    adoption of consumer-level internet access, allowing it to
                    operate somewhat under the radar.

                    torrenting technology gained traction, particularly with the
                    release of BitTorrent in 2001, the BBS-style approach to video
                    game piracy began to wane. Today, torrenting remains the
                    preferred method for those engaged in piracy, rendering previous
                    attempts to curb illegal torrenting largely ineffective due to
                    its decentralized nature, which makes complete dismantling
                    virtually impossible.
